	abstract = {Multiple change-point detection models assume that the observed data is a realization of an independent random process affected by K-1 abrupt changes, called change-points, at some unknown positions. For off-line detection a dynamic programming {(DP)} algorithm retrieves the K-1 change-points minimizing the quadratic loss and reduces the complexity from {{\textbackslash}Theta(n{\textasciicircum}K)} to {{\textbackslash}Theta(Kn{\textasciicircum}2)} where n is the number of observations. The quadratic complexity in n still restricts the use of such an algorithm to small or intermediate values of n. We propose a pruned {DP} algorithm that recovers the optimal solution. We demonstrate that at worst the complexity is in {O(Kn{\textasciicircum}2)} time and {O(Kn)} space and is therefore at worst equivalent to the classical {DP} algorithm. We show empirically that the run-time of our proposed algorithm is drastically reduced compared to the classical {DP} algorithm. More precisely, our algorithm is able to process a million points in a matter of minutes compared to several days with the classical {DP} algorithm. Moreover, the principle of the proposed algorithm can be extended to other convex losses (for example the Poisson loss) and as the algorithm process one observation after the other it could be adapted for on-line problems.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} {Microarray-CGH} experiments are used to detect and map chromosomal imbalances, by hybridizing targets of genomic {DNA} from a test and a reference sample to sequences immobilized on a slide. These probes are genomic {DNA} sequences {(BACs)} that are mapped on the genome. The signal has a spatial coherence that can be handled by specific statistical tools. Segmentation methods seem to be a natural framework for this purpose. A {CGH} profile can be viewed as a succession of segments that represent homogeneous regions in the genome whose {BACs} share the same relative copy number on average. We model a {CGH} profile by a random Gaussian process whose distribution parameters are affected by abrupt changes at unknown coordinates. Two major problems arise: to determine which parameters are affected by the abrupt changes (the mean and the variance, or the mean only), and the selection of the number of segments in the profile. {RESULTS:} We demonstrate that existing methods for estimating the number of segments are not well adapted in the case of array {CGH} data, and we propose an adaptive criterion that detects previously mapped chromosomal aberrations. The performances of this method are discussed based on simulations and publicly available data sets. Then we discuss the choice of modeling for array {CGH} data and show that the model with a homogeneous variance is adapted to this context. {CONCLUSIONS:} Array {CGH} data analysis is an emerging field that needs appropriate statistical tools. Process segmentation and model selection provide a theoretical framework that allows precise biological interpretations. Adaptive methods for model selection give promising results concerning the estimation of the number of altered regions on the genome.},
